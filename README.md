# Password-Hash-Code-File-Creation-and-Password-Verification-Using-MD5

This program to implements and demonstrates the MD5 cryptographic algorithm. Our goals with this program were to simulate and analyze a UNIX-based password security scheme. The basis of such a password security scheme includes saving a user ID, salt value, and password hash code to a password file. This scheme involved using a hash algorithm based on MD5 crypt hash function. The inputs for this function were a salt value along with the corresponding user’s password as input. Using this system, we were successfully able to generate a UNIX-based password hash table. We were also successful in verifying a user’s password.

To use this program compile the interface with g++ and run the a.out file. The program saves the users and their hashed passwords to the password text file.

This project was created for a computer security class at St. Cloud State University in collaborations with Michael Miller, and Nathan Reichert.
